# Why is an inclusive R community important? 

The more mainstream approaches to networking and skills sharing or development can, in some cases, lack diversity and inclusion. 

_These are a bit spicy?_

- Have you ever gone to a panel where we only hear the perspective of those from a single demongraphic of the community? 

- Have you read issues or discussions in the R community and felt discouraged from sharing your work by the aggressive communication style used?

Let's work together in our safe space to build a community where we share learnings, upskill each other and facilitate network building.
