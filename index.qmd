TL;DR 
Rage against the patriarchy. 

time of change in terms of tools and tech -> people who already have the skills (exposure) progressing faster -> particular demographic overrepresented in the skills -> self-fullfilling  

only white men are driving the agenda and in a self-fullfilling... 

# What is PROUD? 
PROUD is an inclusive R community for developers who work in the pharma space. Trying to address the structural inequality that affects our community.  

# What are PROUD's objectives? 
The goals of PROUD are to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build their network. 

# How can I get involved? 

There are several ways to get involved with PROUD. We have two main tracks:

1. Build your network  
- enable conference organisers to select from a diverse pool of R developers for representations on panels, talks, etc.   
- opportunty for cross-industry collaboration with focus on inclusivity  
2. Upskilling and knowledge sharing
